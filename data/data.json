{"Hinge": "\nPrivacy\nOUR COMMITMENT TO YOU\nAt Hinge, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful connections.\nWe appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information, and we do not take this lightly.\nOur commitment to privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to make sure that our decisions are taken with the utmost respect for your privacy.\nOur commitment to transparency. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we\u2019re doing our best to write our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!\nOur commitment to security. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.\nPRIVACY POLICY\nWelcome to Hinge\u2019s Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.\nWe appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.\nThis Privacy Policy applies from March 28, 2022. The previous version of this Privacy Policy, available here, applies until then.\n- WHO WE ARE\n- WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES\n- INFORMATION WE COLLECT\n- COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES\n- HOW WE USE INFORMATION\n- HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION\n- CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS\n- YOUR RIGHTS\n- HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION\n- CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY\n- JOB CANDIDATES, CONTRACTORS AND VENDOR REPRESENTATIVES\n- PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES\n- HOW TO CONTACT US\nPlease see our California Privacy Statement to learn about California privacy rights.\n1. WHO WE ARE\nIf you live in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), the United Kingdom or Switzerland, the company responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the \"data controller\") is:\nMTCH Technology Services Limited\nHinge\nWeWork Charlemont Exchange\n42 Charlemont Street\nDublin 2, D02 R593\nIf you live outside the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, the company responsible for your information is:\nHinge, Inc.\n809 Washington Street, Third Floor\nNew York, NY 10014\n2. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES\nThis Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the brand Hinge. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our \"services\" in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we\u2019ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.\nSome services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.\n3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT\nIt goes without saying, we can\u2019t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you\u2019d like to meet. We also collect information about your use of our services such as access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through your social media account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your profile. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.\nInformation you give us\nYou choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:\n- When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials and/or phone number, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.\n- When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos or audio clips. To add certain content, like pictures, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.\n- When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.\n- When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.\n- When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.\n- If you contact us (e.g., through our customer care team or on social media), we collect the information you give us during the interaction.\n- If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a given feature), we process this information on your behalf in order to complete your request.\n- Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the operation of the services.\nInformation we receive from others\nIn addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:\nUsers\n- Users may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.\nSocial Media\n- You may decide to share information with us through your social media account, for instance if you decide to create and log into your Hinge account via your social media or other account (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or to upload onto our services information such as photos from one of your social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram\u2026).\nAffiliates\n- Hinge is part of the Match Group family of businesses. Match Group considers the safety and security of users a top priority. If you were banned from another Match Group service, your information can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our services.\nOther Partners\n- We may receive information about you from our partners, where Hinge ads are published on a partner\u2019s service (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign\u2019s success). Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our users\u2019 safety and security.\nInformation generated when you use our services\nWhen you use our services, this generates technical data about which features you\u2019ve used, how you\u2019ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:\nUsage Information\n- Using the services generates data about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., when you logged in, features you\u2019ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, when you exchanged with them, number of messages you send and receive).\nDevice Information\n- We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device\u2019 settings), identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.\nOther Information with your Consent\n- If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude). The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren\u2019t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your precise geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo or video or participate in streaming features on our services).\n4. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES\nWe use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels and SDKs) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them and how you can better control their use.\nSome web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a \"Do Not Track\" (\"DNT\") feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser\u2019s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Hinge, do not currently respond to DNT signals.\n5. HOW WE USE INFORMATION\nThe main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe, and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.

To prevent, detect and fight fraud and other illegal or unauthorized activities\n- Find and address ongoing, suspected or alleged violations of our Terms, notably through the review of reports and interactions between members.\n- Better understand and design countermeasures against violations of our Terms\n- Retain data related to violations of our Terms to prevent against recurrences\n- Enforce or exercise our rights, for example our Terms\n- Communicate to users what we\u2019ve done as a result of their reports.\nF. To ensure legal compliance\n- Comply with legal requirements\n- Assist law enforcement\nFor information on how we process personal information through profiling and automated decision-making, please see our FAQ.\nTo process your information as described in this Privacy Policy, we rely on the following legal bases:\n- Provide our service to you: The reason we process your information for purposes A and B above is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you and to otherwise provide our free and paid features.\n- Legitimate interests: We process your information for purposes C, D and E above, based on our legitimate interest. For instance, we analyze users\u2019 behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you and promote our own services, we process information to help keep our users safe and we process data where necessary to enforce our rights, assist law enforcement and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a legal action.\n- Comply with applicable laws and regulations: We process your information for purpose F above where it is necessary for us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and evidence our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we retain traffic data and data about transactions in line with our accounting, tax and other statutory data retention obligations and to be able to respond to valid access requests from law enforcement. We also keep data evidencing consents users give us and decisions they may have taken to opt-out of a given feature or processing.\n- Consent: If you choose to provide us with information that may be considered \"special\" or \"sensitive\" in certain jurisdictions, such as your sexual orientation, you\u2019re consenting to our processing of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may ask for your consent to collect specific information such as your precise geolocation or use your information for certain specific reasons. In some cases, you may withdraw your consent by adapting your settings (for instance in relation to the collection of our precise geolocation) or by deleting your content (for instance where you entered information in your profile that may be considered \"special\" or \"sensitive\"). In any case, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.\n6. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION\nSince our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users\u2019 information is, of course, with other users. We also share some users\u2019 information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies for specified reasons as laid out below and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.\nWith other users\n- You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you\u2019re comfortable being visible.\n- If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.\n- If someone submits a report involving you (such as a claim that you violated our Terms), we may communicate to the reporter actions, if any, we took as a result of their report.\nWith our service providers and partners\n- We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations. We also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.\n- We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. Our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.\nWith our affiliates\n- Hinge is part of the Match Group family of businesses.\n- We share your information with affiliates for limited legitimate purposes as laid out below:\n-- to make all Match Group platforms safer, by making sure that when a bad actor is found on one of them (for instance on our services), it is not only addressed there (for instance by banning them), but also on the others.\n-- for them to assist us in data processing operations, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf. Their assistance may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, analytics, finance and accounting assistance, improving our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.\n-- in order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities. We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse. Examples of such opportunities may include the creation of a new service within Match Group, addressing a specific demographic that we think might be interesting to you based on your profile.\n-- for other legitimate business purposes including corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting, where and as allowed under applicable laws.\nFor corporate transactions\n- We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.\nWith law enforcement / when required by law\n- We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.\nTo enforce legal rights\n- We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.\nWith your consent or at your request\n- We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.\nWe may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.\n7. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS\nThe sharing of information laid out in Section 6 [Deep link] involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. When we transfer personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries which data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental body, we use standard contract clauses (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or other appropriate transfer mechanism. We are currently in the process of reviewing transfers to our vendors and associated legal basis further to the recent Court of Justice for the European Union\u2019s ruling on transfers of personal data to the USA.\n8. YOUR RIGHTS\nWe want you to be in control of your information, so we want to remind you of the following options and tools available to you:\n- Access / Update tools in the service. Tools and account settings can help you access, rectify or remove information that you provided to us and that\u2019s associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here.\n- Device permissions. Mobile platforms can have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone contacts, pictures, location services, push notifications and advertising identifiers. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection or processing of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose functionality.\n- Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. Remember that uninstalling an app does NOT close your account. To close your account, please use the corresponding functionality on the service.\n- Account closure. You can close your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.\nWe also want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:\n- Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability, right to know or variations of those terms). You can exercise this right by putting in such a request here.\n- Updating your information. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, object to or restrict its processing, please contact us here.\n- For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.\n- Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from them through our service, the other user will have to contact us to submit a separate request for their information. We may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request.\n- Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot ensure that you are 18 years of age or older.\nIn certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area here, and in the United Kingdom here. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.\n9. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION\nWe keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services, you can close your account and your profile will stop being visible to other users. After your account is closed, we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:\n- To protect the safety and security of our users, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure. During this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.\n- Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below:\n- We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements. We may also need to keep \"traffic data\" / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents users give us for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law.\n- We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as imprecise location of download/purchase to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent users who were banned or people who were found to be under the age of 18 from opening a new account, to ensure the safety and vital interests of our users.\n- Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings).\n10. CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY\nOur services are restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.\n11. JOB CANDIDATES, CONTRACTORS AND VENDOR REPRESENTATIVES\nWe also process the personal information of our job candidates, contractors and vendor representatives, as part of our recruitment and talent management operations and our management of the services that contractors and vendors provide to us. If you are a job candidate, contractor or vendor representative of Hinge, certain relevant terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your personal information, including the sections of this Privacy Policy that discuss the entity that is responsible for the processing of your personal information, transfers of personal information, rights you may have under applicable law, how to contact us and California-specific information.\nIf you are a job applicant, the personal information we process about you may vary depending on the job you seek but typically includes what you provide to us as part of your job application as well as professional qualifications, background and reference information that recruiters or other third parties share with us. We use this information to support the recruitment process, which may lead to an employment contract. For contractors and vendor representatives, we may process identification information and work-related information, as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer, which is necessary for the performance of the services agreement, and to establish, exercise or defend potential legal claims. We may share personal information with service providers that assist us with recruitment and technical data processing operations as well as with Match Group companies (for instance if you have a business relationship with employees of an affiliate). We keep your personal information only as long as necessary for those purposes.\n12. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES\nBecause we\u2019re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations about our data practices remain up-to-date, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.\n13.

And if you\u2019re after more detail have a look at these topics.\nWhat's not covered in this policy?\nOur services sometimes link to services run by other companies' services, like opening a track from BBC Sounds on another music service such as Spotify. Those companies have their own privacy and cookies policies, so remember that the information you give them will follow their rules and not ours.\nSometimes you can access our services from other places, like a BBC Radio 1 YouTube page or the BBC iPlayer app on your connected TV. Make sure to check their privacy policy so you know how they will use your information.\n-\n3. How do you protect my personal information?\nWe're strongly committed to keeping you and your family's information safe. And to do this we design our services with your safety in mind. We also have dedicated teams to look after your information security and privacy.\nAt the same time, no service can be completely secure - if you have any concerns that your BBC account or personal information has been put at risk, for example if someone could have found out your password, please get in touch straight away.\nWhere we store your information\nSome companies that provide services to us run their services from outside the UK and the European Economic Area. We only let that happen if we are satisfied with their levels of security. Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be being transferred, stored or processed in a location outside the UK and the EEA.\n-\n4.

To do that, \"Allow Personalisation\" is set to on when you create an account. If you\u2019re under 13 and create an account your personalisation is set to off. Information about how you use our online services is then connected with other information you give us to personalise your experience.\nIf you don\u2019t want us to do this, you can always turn personalisation off in your account settings. If you\u2019re under 13 you don\u2019t need to do anything.\ne. to show you relevant advertising on another company's site\nf. to help us understand what kind of services you might use\nAnd sometimes how you might share things with other people\ng. to recommend things we think might interest you\nh. to show you advertising when you access a BBC service from outside the UK\nSome of this advertising might be tailored to you.\ni. to research and innovate\nYou're not a guinea-pig here, but knowing how you use our services could lead to the next big technology breakthrough.\nj. to contact you about various things\n-\n7.

Or it might be about creating a child account\n- to contact you about a creation you sent us, like things you\u2019ve sent in to School Report news day\n- to answer you when you\u2019ve contacted us, or to respond to a comment or complaint\n- to invite you to take part in surveys about BBC services, which are always voluntary\n- for marketing purposes\n- to send you notifications on your device depending on your settings\nWe\u2019ll only contact you when we need to or when you\u2019ve given us permission.\nWe\u2019ll never contact you to ask for your BBC account password.\n-\n8.

This could be showing you a BBC sponsored message where we know you have a BBC account and have used BBC services.\nWhere we do this, we will share your data in a hashed format with these providers so that, where you have an account on the same platform, you will see adverts from the BBC. In these scenarios, we are joint controllers with these companies because we jointly determine the purposes and means of processing your personal data.\nWe also assess certain characteristics of our audience members in order to find others who are similar to them to provide advertising to those individuals.\nIf you don\u2019t want to see our targeted advertising, you can set ad preferences in your social media companies\u2019 settings. Also, you can visit your BBC account and turn this off.\n-\n9. When does the BBC share my personal information with others?\nWe'll never sell your personal information.

When you do this we\u2019ll share an identifier for your BBC account with the company who runs the service you are using. Make sure to check that company\u2019s privacy policy so you know how it will use your information. The BBC isn\u2019t responsible when you access a BBC service through another company\u2019s services. It\u2019s up to you if you want to access the BBC in this way.\ne. When we do collaborative research\nWe do research activities and sometimes collaborate with research partners. Every now and then we share our content and data with them. This might include information we\u2019ve collected about you. But we\u2019re careful about what we share and what our research partners can do with it.\nf.

We share personal information about you to others but we follow some rules\nThe main rule is we will never sell your personal information to anyone.\ne.

For example:\n- so that adults don't post comments on kid's message boards\n- when you want to get a BBC account\n- When you're watching a programme, like on BBC iPlayer, and it's a bit edgy\nf. Sometimes we'll ask to get your parent or guardian's consent\nYou'll see a notification. We might also ask for some details from them, so that we can contact them. Other times we may contact your parent or guardian:\n- so you can get notifications from us\n- so we can show you more things we think you'll like, based on what you do\n- so you can post comments\n- so you can upload your contribution to us\ng.

Or your parent or guardian can do this if you\u2019re under 13.\nBut other cookies can\u2019t be turned off.\nm. What we do when you post, upload or share a creation\nWhen you share your creation with us we'll try to tell you exactly what we're going to do with it.\nn. You've got privacy rights, the same as adults, so get to know what they are\nYou can:\n- ask us what personal information we hold about you\n- ask us to correct or delete your personal information\n- tell us to stop using your personal information\nIf you're 13 or older, you can do this yourself, but not always. Sometimes we'll be asking for your parent or guardian to do that.\nIf you're under 13 your parent or guardian probably has to do it for you.\n-\n11.

For example, unsubscribing from any marketing emails or turning off personalisation\nBear in mind, sometimes we might not be able to help. Like if the law tells us we can't or it forms part of our journalistic output.\n-\n13. How does the BBC use cookies and similar tracking?\na. What are cookies and tracking technologies?\nCookies are small text files which are transferred to your computer or mobile when you visit a website or app.\nThere are also similar pieces of tracking information we collect.\nb. Why do we use cookies and other tracking?\nTo do a few different things:\n- to remember information about you, so you don't have to give it to us again. And again. And again\n- to keep you signed in, even on different devices\n- to help us understand how people are using our services, so we can make them better\n- to deliver advertising to websites outside of the UK\n- to help us personalise the BBC to you by remembering your preferences and settings. And your progress, so you can pause and pick up where you left off watching a programme even on a different device\n- to find out if our emails have been read and if you find them useful\nc. What are the types of cookies?\nSome cookies are always on when you visit us, and you can\u2019t turn them off unless you change your browser settings. We call these \"strictly necessary cookies\". We use them to make sure our digital services work correctly and are meeting audience needs and interests.\nWe also use functional, performance and advertising cookies to make your experience more enjoyable. You can switch these on or off at any time and you can always change your mind. We\u2019ll only use them if you\u2019ve agreed.\nBear in mind there are some other cookies out there from other companies. These \"third-party cookies\" might track how you use different websites, including ours. For example, you might get a social media company\u2019s cookie when you see the option to share something. You can turn them off, but not through us.\nd. How do cookies last?\nSome are erased when you close the browser on your website or app. Others stay longer, sometimes forever, and are saved onto your device so that they\u2019re there when you come back.\ne. How do I control my cookies and tracking?\nStrictly necessary cookies are always on when you visit us. On your first visit to us, we\u2019ll tell you about our other types of cookies and ask you to choose which cookies we can use. You can always change your mind by going to your settings.\nStopping all cookies might mean you can\u2019t access some BBC services, or that some of them might not work properly for you.\nAnother way to control some tracking is in the settings on your device.\n-\n14.

The statement applies to all Opera software applications, websites and services.\nAs a general rule, users of our software applications and services are anonymous to us, and we have no feasible ways to identify you. However certain categories of data may be collected while using our applications and services, and some of this information may be considered \"personal data\" by the law. When we collect personal data, we generally act as a \"data controller\" as defined in applicable law. The exact categories of data we collect, why we collect it, and your opt-out choices depend on the application or service you use, as is more fully described below.\nWhen we post changes to this privacy statement, we will include the date when the statement was last updated. If we significantly change this statement, we will notify you about the upcoming change via our website or using in-app notifications. We encourage you to review this statement periodically.\nUser-submitted Data\nCertain pieces of information we will only process when you submit it to us.\nWhen creating an Opera account we may ask for a preferred username and an email address. The email address will be used to identify you as a user and for password recovery. Alternatively you can use your Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or VK account to sign in into an Opera account and access our services with the same profile. In this case we may collect your name and email address from these social networks. You can delete or modify the submitted data using your profile page. We retain your data for seven days after you\u2019ve decided to discontinue your Opera account in case you change your mind. Your Opera account with a verified email address will be deleted automatically if you don\u2019t sign in for 2 years. Accounts with unverified email addresses will be deleted after 6 months of inactivity.\nNote also that Opera allows you to sync your browser data, such as Speed Dial entries and bookmarks, between devices that have another Opera browser installed on them. Profile sync relies on your Opera account and follows the same privacy approach.\nIf you decide to provide feedback to Opera or participate in a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, organized by Opera or our partners on behalf of Opera, we may ask for information such as your name, age, phone number, email or postal address.\nIf you agree to receive marketing information from Opera via email, SMS, or push notifications, we may use third-party technology providers to deliver such messages to you. You can opt-out from marketing communication at any time in your user profile settings or directly from a marketing email you receive.\nIf you submit your phone number or email address on an application download page, we may send you a download link via SMS or email for your convenience.\nIf you represent one of Opera\u2019s customers or suppliers and have submitted data about your organization\u2019s directors or officers in the course of a due diligence request from Opera, this information will be retained for three years.\nWe will use this data only to provide the services you have requested and will not retain your data any longer than necessary to fulfill that specific purpose. If you\u2019re not comfortable with us using submitted data for a limited purpose, then don\u2019t provide it to us.\nAnonymous Usage Statistics\nWhen you install an Opera application, a random installation ID is generated. We may collect this identifier, as well as your device ID and hardware specification, operating system and environment configuration, and feature usage data.\nWe use this information for certain legitimate business purposes, namely:\n- To understand better how people interact with our applications and services;\n- To enhance, modify, customize or otherwise improve our applications and services;\n- To determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising;\n- To detect, debug and fix crashes in our applications and services;\n- To prevent security breaches and abuse.\nIn short, this information helps us to improve our products and services. We have no practical way to use this information to identify you personally. We may store this usage data for up to three years. If you would like to learn about your opt-out choices, please refer to our help pages.\nNews\nTo provide you with more relevant news content in certain countries and languages, we collect some information about the articles you read in the application\u2019s native news feed, and your general location. This information is linked to a randomly generated News ID and may be stored on our servers for up to three months.\nPersonalized Ads\nBased on advertising IDs and your general location, some of our mobile applications may serve targeted ads. These ads are provided by our monetization partners. You can always adjust your personalized ad choices in the application\u2019s \"Settings\" menu or through your operating system\u2019s settings.\nWe collect this data pursuant to our legitimate business interests. As noted in our End User License Agreements and Terms of Service, our applications are ad-supported. Collecting this information helps us offset the costs of our business and helps provide a more personalized experience for the user.\nCrash Reports and Logs\nIf an Opera application crashes, we collect a log that includes some information about your browser\u2019s version, your operating system, platform and some memory data related to the crash. We collect this data with the sole purpose of improving our products and services. Crash logs are kept for 6 months.\nIf you visit our websites, we may collect your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites. We use IP addresses solely for this purpose and may keep website access logs up to six months.\nFeature-specific Data Points\nBrowser Assistant. Your copy of Opera for computers may include a component that displays desktop notifications promoting the browser\u2019s features. It checks if any notifications are pending on a scheduled basis and may anonymously report occurrences of certain system events (namely low battery, low hard disk space, new Wi-Fi network connected, another browser installed). This information is not collected by us and no personal information is sent.\nBrowser Extensions. When you install extensions from the Opera Addons website, please note that these extensions are often developed by third parties and are subject to their own privacy terms. Please carefully review the terms before installing extensions.\nBrowser VPN. When you use our built-in VPN service, we do not log any information related to your browsing activity and originating network address.\nData Compression. Extreme-savings mode (in Opera Mini) renders web pages on our servers before sending a compressed version of the content to the application on your device. High-savings mode (Opera Turbo) does not render content, but our servers look through your requests to see if any elements on the page can be compressed before sending them to your device. If you use Opera Mini or Turbo data compression features, we log a randomly generated ID, advertising ID (on mobile devices), your IP address and URLs of your requests that are sent through our servers, but not the content. We may also log a phone number and IMEI, if they were provided by your mobile operator. We use this data to debug and improve our services, and we may store it in our server logs for up to 45 days. Then we anonymize and aggregate this data and may allow our business partners access to it.\nDefault Search Engines. When visiting some search engine websites, the website may query if it is set as the default search engine in the application\u2019s settings, and suggest to set itself as the default search engine.\nDify Cashback. Dify Cashback is an incentive program where you can earn rewards when purchasing goods or services from participating online merchants. When you enable the Cashback service in the browser and visit supported websites, we\u2019ll collect a merchant\u2019s URL, list of your purchased items, transaction amount, and IP address. This data is required for the Cashback service to function, and we may also use it to provide more relevant partner deals, detect fraud and misuse of the service.

Your data will be stored for up to 5 years due to regulatory requirements, and the account itself can be deleted by yourself or automatically after 2 years of inactivity.\nGamebox.

Depending on where you live, you may be able to access the Hype messaging service. If you choose to use Hype, you will be prompted to give us your phone number, which is required to operate the service.

We will retain your phone number and contacts for as long as you use Hype. Additionally, you also have the option to upload profile information at your discretion, including a user name, avatar, and your friends. If you delete your account, or go inactive for a while, we will retain this data for a short period of time in case you decide to reactivate.\nLoomi by Opera. Depending on where you live, you may be able to access the Loomi Service to stream or download movies and other content from within the browser or via the Loomi.tv website. If you use the Loomi Service, Opera will collect the following data:\n- Opera Auth account data. Using Loomi requires creating an Opera Auth account. We use your Auth account data to provide and administer the Loomi Service, for example to determine your default language, to list titles you have watched and payments you have made, and to inform you about changes to the Service. We retain this data for as long as your Auth account is active (as described above).\n- Content-related data. We collect data, such as the titles you have viewed, titles you have rented, and where you have left off in a movie, in order to manage your account and so that you can resume viewing at a later time. We also collect additional data, such as your IP address and a unique, randomly-assigned internal identification number, in order to comply with certain legal and/or contractual obligations, such as ensuring that you are located in a territory covered by the applicable content license, and detecting abusive or illegal use of the Loomi Service. Information about titles and views is associated with your Opera Auth account and will be retained for as long as your account is active. IP address and internal identifiers are deleted as soon as you close the applicable tab or navigate to a different tab.\n- Usage statistics. We collect information, such as user agent, operating system, IP address and content identifiers, for the purposes of debugging and improving the Loomi Service.

We also use suppliers such as EZDRM to manage content license compliance, and Neutrino to detect improper VPN usage.\nMalicious-site Check. We use a fraud prevention framework and check the URLs you visit against lists of known, malicious websites to protect you online. We don\u2019t store or share this data.\nMy Flow. If you use the \"My Flow\" function in Opera for computers or the Opera Touch browser, a random ID is generated by the Flow server and assigned to each client device. These IDs are used solely to enable pairing functionality between desktop and mobile applications and persist only while your devices are connected to My Flow. Your data is protected with end-to-end encryption and we retain it only as long as you continue to use the feature. You can disconnect your devices from My Flow, and delete your data through the application\u2019s Settings menu.\nSocial Login. Some of our applications use Firebase Authentication by Google to provide a quick and simple authentication service for your user account. To enable this service, you agree to share your email, phone number, user-agent string and IP address of your device with Google and Opera. All the information is needed to provide and improve the service.

Our guiding principle is that any data we collect from you will be treated with the utmost care and respect, and every effort will be made to ensure the data is kept private.\nIf you have any questions about the Policy, please contact:\nDigipom Legal and Privacy Services\nprivacy@digipom.com\nCompliance with Privacy Laws\nDigipom is committed to complying with the privacy and data protection laws applicable to you. These include but are not limited to: (1) the \"GDPR\", the European data protection law which stands for \"General Data Protection Regulation\", with the official name Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council; (2) \"PIPEDA\" (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), which is the Canadian data protection law that applies to our activities in Canada; (3) the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") which applies to our activities in the United States in certain circumstances; and (4) Brazil\u2019s Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados (\"LGPD\").\nUnder applicable law, Digipom Inc. is the \"data controller\" of Personal Data collected through the Services. \"Personal Data\" is any data that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with an identified or identifiable natural person, or a specific household. For the purposes of this Policy, \"Personal Data\" is equivalent to \"Personal Information\" as defined in the CCPA and PIPEDA.\nWhat Personal Data does Digipom collect?\nThe Personal Data we may collect about you through the Services falls into the general categories described below. Please see further in the section \"Categories of Personal Data Collected under the CCPA\".\nInformation that you provide voluntarily\nCertain parts of our Services may ask you to provide Personal Data voluntarily. For example, we may ask for certain information in order to use features in our Apps, register an account with us, subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us, such as:\n- your name, email address or other contact details.\n- any information you submit to our customer service team in the App or via email.\nThe Personal Data that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be explained to you when we ask you to provide your Personal Data.\nInformation we collect automatically\nWhen you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered Personal Data under applicable data protection laws, such as:\n- Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-app usage, session length, preferred settings, which in-app advertisements you may have viewed, crash reports, and the means by which you were referred to our Services).\n- Your IP address, device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, other device information, and your general geographic location (e.g. country or city location) based on your IP address.\n\"Advertising ID\" includes the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (\"IDFA\") on Apple, and the Google Advertising Identity (\"GAID\") on Android. These are unique identifiers for mobile devices that advertisers use for interest-based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow tracking across apps. These identifiers can be reset from the device\u2019s settings. On Apple, you can opt out by choosing the \"limit ad tracking\" option in the privacy settings. On Android, you can opt out by choosing \"Opt out of interest based ads.\"\nAdvertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognize your device when you use websites and applications.\n\"Device information\" means device type, model, manufacturer, operating system and language, or other technical data like supported application programming interfaces (\"APIs\"), screen size, processor, or a combination of this data, available from a device for a developer to check the device\u2019s compatibility with a particular application.\nSome of this information may be collected using cookies and/or similar technologies, such as software development kits (\"SDKs\"). The Services may use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags, local shared objects, hardware-based device identifiers, flash cookies, operating system-based identifiers, clear GIFs and web beacons. Cookies are pieces of data that sites and services can set on your browser or device that can be read on future visits. We may expand our use of cookies to save additional data as new features are added to our Services. However, you can disable cookies by changing your browser settings. Further information about how to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider\u2019s help screen.\nInformation we obtain from third party sources\n(a) Third party service providers.\nWe may receive Personal Data about you from third-party sources. We may obtain your Personal Data, for example, when you installed our App or when, prior to installation, you click on an advertisement for the App (see the \"Third-Party Advertisements\" section below for more information).\nIn order to better understand our users of the Services, we may conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the information collected. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.\nDigipom may use Google Analytics (see http://www.google.com/analytics/), Google Firebase Analytics (see https://firebase.google.com/features/analytics/), Crashlytics (see https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf) or other similar services to collect such information.\nThe Application makes use of Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting (see https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357) which gives Digipom certain demographic and interest information about our Application users. None of this information, however, can identify you personally to Digipom. The information may be used to serve you advertisements that will be of interest to you. You can disable this feature through your Android settings of your Device or the Google Settings App. You can also opt out of such Google advertising at any time by visiting your Google Ads Settings page (see https://www.google.com/settings/ads).\n(b) Advertising partners.\nFrom time to time, we may also receive Personal Data about you from other third-party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement directing you to one of our Services (such as an ad for one of our Apps in another publishers\u2019 app), we will be provided with Data about which ad network and advertising campaign the install originated from. Please see the Advertising section below for more information.\nCategories of Personal Data Collected under the CCPA\nWe collect the following categories of Personal Data as defined in the CCPA, and have done so in the past 12 months:\n- Identifiers (your name, email or other contact information, when provided);\n- Internet or other electronic network activity information on our Internet Web sites and applications, including, but not limited to, browsing history, search history, and information regarding your interaction with an Internet Web site, application, or advertisement; and\n- Geolocation data.\nWhat we don\u2019t collect\nUnder no circumstances does Digipom collect, download or otherwise make copies of any recordings you make using any of our apps (hereinafter \"Recordings\") and any reference to Personal Data in the present Policy does not include Recordings, or any Personal Data about you or any third party included in the Recordings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may make copies of Recordings via application or operating system features (such as the share menu or via file system access), and/or by uploading them to various cloud services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and iCloud. However, Digipom has no access whatsoever to these copies and therefore any Personal Data about you or any third party contained in the copies of Recordings is also not covered by this Policy.\nHow we use your Personal Data\nWe use your Personal Data for the following purposes:\nTo provide and operate our Services\n- To provide you with the correct versions of our apps (e.g. knowing which language to make our apps available to you in).\nTo improve our Services and keep them secure\n- To respond to your customer support requests (e.g. if you write to us with a complaint),\n- To receive error messages about any issues you or your device encounter with our Services to enable us to fix bugs and interoperability issues,\n- To detect and prevent illegal activities,\n- To track App installs (e.g. for purposes of measuring the effectiveness of marketing campaigns),\n- To conduct optional user feedback surveys,\n- To understand you, your preferences and user traffic to enhance your experience and enjoyment of our Services,\n- To conduct research.\nTo personalize our Services\n- To remember you the next time you visit one of our Services,\n- To communicate with you about promotions, rewards, upcoming events, and other news about products and services we offer.\nFor promotional activities, including marketing and advertising\n- To provide you with in-app offers and rewards based on your in-app behaviors,\n- To serve you with relevant targeted advertisements (necessary to fund our Services),\n- To make you offers to purchase in-app items on discount based on your in-app activity and purchase history,\n- To send you marketing communications and/or newsletters about rewards and promotions if you have subscribed to them.\nOther\n- To comply with our legal obligations,\n- To exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or to protect your vital interests or those of any other person,\n- To prevent and/or detect fraud or fraudulent behavior.\nAdvertising\nWe use advertising to fund our Services and to make some of our apps or versions of our apps available for free. We show third-party advertising in our Apps and also advertise our Services via third parties. We want to provide you with more detail about how we use information for advertising, both in our properties and in third-party properties.\nWhen you view ads in Digipom properties (e.g. in our Apps)\nTo enable us to show in-app ads, we may send your advertising ID, IP address and device information to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our Apps and on third-party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. Digipom does not control which specific ads are shown in our apps (this is controlled by the ad networks), but we do prohibit certain types of ads.\nAdvertising IDs are used by ad networks for a number of purposes, including, for example, to:\n- Limit the number of times you see the same ad.\n- Ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not automated \"bots\".\n- Serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID, your engagement with other brands and ads which is recorded using your advertising ID, and to use your general geographic area.\n- Other brands may buy ad placements via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in our Apps. The ad network or ad exchange acts as an intermediary between the other app companies and Digipom. In order for the ad network to charge the company purchasing the ad, clicks from the ad and potential installs of other developers\u2019 apps are tracked. These views, clicks and installs from ads are measured using the Advertising ID.\n- Track which apps you have used to market you similar kind of apps. Your IP address is typically used by advertisers to identify your general geographic location, for example, your country, state and, sometimes, your city.\nWhen you view Digipom ads on third-party services\nDigipom also advertises its Apps on other apps by asking ad networks to place ads for audiences that will be interested in them, determined using Advertising IDs. Ad networks use Advertising IDs for this and other purposes, including, for example, to:\n- Measure ad effectiveness (including total views, clicks and installs generated by its advertising in other publishers\u2019 apps),\n- Not display ads for an app a user is already using. Digipom may send a list of active users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. The ad network then excludes these users from seeing the ad.\nThird-party advertisements\nWhere you have downloaded one of our apps, we may use Google, a third-party vendor, to serve advertisements in the App, using the AdMob system (see http://www.admob.com/home/privacy).\nIn addition to Google advertisements, from time to time we may allow other third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous data when you use the Application. This list currently includes:\n- Fluct (see https://corp.fluct.jp/privacy/ads/)\n- InMobi (see https://www.inmobi.com/privacy-policy/)\n- Mobfox (see https://www.mobfox.com/privacy-policy/)\n- Pubmatic (see https://pubmatic.com/legal/privacy-policy/)\n- Tappx (see https://www.tappx.com/privacy-policy/)\n- Unity (see https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy)\nHuawei AppGallery only:\n- Huawei Ads (see https://consumer.huawei.com/en/privacy/privacy-policy/)\nYou can opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by changing the privacy settings of your device and selecting \"limit ad tracking\" (Apple iOS) or \"opt out of interest-based ads\" (Android).\nLegal basis for processing personal data\nOur legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

This section describes\nmechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of your information.\n- Advertising IDs. An advertising ID is a non-persistent, resettable identifier of your device that is used for purposes of online behavioral advertising.

Additionally or alternatively, you can reset your advertising ID at any time (and as frequently as you would like), which causes Google\u2019s or Apple\u2019s system to build your device\u2019s profile for advertising purposes anew, so that advertisers cannot link your activities taking place prior to the reset to your device.\n- Other Tracking Technologies.

We will thereafter delete or anonymise your data as soon as possible.\nHelp us improve the Sleep Cycle app\nWe appreciate if you would like to help us improve the Sleep Cycle app by contributing with your health data. If we know how you are using the app, know about your sleep patterns and surrounding circumstances, etc. we can improve the app \u2013 this will make our, and ultimately your, insights better and more to the point and this will also improve your user experience. For this purpose, we will only use pseudonymised data, meaning that your health data will be awarded a hashed ID.\nYour data will be stored in our product development environment (separate from the backup environment), hosted by Amplitude Inc. and their service provider Amazon Web Services. Learn more under \"How we share your personal data and who we share it with\".\nWe will keep your data until you withdraw your consent or up to three (3) years from collection, whichever is longer. If you withdraw your consent we will immediately delete or anonymise your health data.\nHelp us improve the world\nProvide aggregated and anonymous insights/statistics\nIf you consent, we may use your data (including health data) to share publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about sleep and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services. We will only share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you as an individual.\nYour data will be stored on our secure servers, hosted by Google Cloud. Learn more about Google Cloud under \"How we share your personal data and who we share it with\".\nIf you withdraw your consent, we will stop using your data in the community benchmarking information. However, we may continue to store data that we have already collected based on your consent for statistical and scientific purposes (GDPR, art 9.2(j)). If so, your data will be stored only in pseudonymised form.\nResearch studies\nWe want to make the world a better place and contribute in the best way we can. We have a large user base who uses the app on a daily basis. Many research projects are interested in gaining access to our users\u2019 personal data and consequently, we may ask you to participate in a research study from time to time. If you want to participate, we will share your personal data (as identified in each individual case) with the investigator in question. Once the investigator has received your data, the investigator will be the data controller for any sub-sequent processing of the data.\nYour personal data may be shared with the investigator \"one-off\" or on an ongoing and continuous basis, depending on the set up of the research project. If you withdraw your consent during a research study, we will immediately stop sharing your personal data. Your withdrawal does not affect previous transfers of data.\nDepending on the research project, and the investigator, your data may be transferred to a country outside the EEA. We will make sure that your data enjoys the same level of protection as if it had remained within the EEA. For this purpose we will enter into EU Model Clauses with the investigator. Your data will be encrypted during transfer.\nYou will receive separate, and more specific, information about the research study in question in connection with signing-up to participate.\nHow we share your personal data and who we share it with\nThe data we store and otherwise process about you will be stored on secure servers hosted by Google Cloud. In addition, data that we process for product development purposes will be transferred to our product development environment (separate from the backup environment) hosted by Amplitude Inc. and their service provider Amazon Web Services.\nWe also use other service providers that may process your data on our behalf. When we communicate with you, for example via e-mail, your e-mail address may be transferred to Mailgun Technologies Inc. and Leanplum Inc. who provide e-mail and communication services. In order to provide the best possible customer support, we use the services of Zendesk Inc. We use Fivetran Inc. to facilitate transfers of data between the service providers mentioned above. Fivetran Inc. will only store data for twenty-four (24) hours.\nAs you may understand, this means that your data may be processed both within the EU/EEA, as well as in other locations outside the EU/EEA, including in the U.S. In order to ensure that your data enjoys the same level of protection as if it had remained within the EU/EEA, we have entered into EU Model Clauses with all our service providers who process personal data outside of the EU/EEA.

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.\n6. What choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\nYou have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information. You can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.\nYour browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, our system does not support and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning the collection and use of your personal information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from Blizzard (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact us at DPO@blizzard.com. Please indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs.\n7. What about Children?\nChildren Under 13\nOnce a child states that his/her age is under 13, they will be unable to register an account with us. We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children\u2019 personal information, they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at DPO@blizzard.com.\nNote to Parents\nWe recognize a special obligation to protect personal information about young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online. Teenagers under the age of 20 and over the age of 13 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls area at https://us.battle.net/account/parental-controls/index.html.\n8. What is Real ID?\nReal ID friends can see each other\u2019s real-life name and can see each other\u2019s characters across all Blizzard products and services. By participating in Real ID, you will have the option of making your real name visible to your friend\u2019s friends, who will also be able to invite you to become friends. The controls for Real ID are located in Battle.net account management.\nWhen you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you will have access to several additional features, including:\n- Real Names for Friends: Your Real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list, when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing a character's profile.\n- Cross-Realm and Cross-Game Chat: With Real ID, friends can chat cross-realm, cross-faction, and cross-game using Blizzard\u2019s products and services.\n- Rich Presence: You will see additional info on your friends list about what your Real ID friends are up to in Blizzard\u2019s products and services in real time.\n9. What is Global Play?\nCertain Blizzard games feature \"Global Play,\" which allows you to play with other players outside of the region associated with the creation of your Blizzard account. This feature is very beneficial to players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions. The Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.\n10. What are tracking technologies and how are they used?\nAs is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.\nBlizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers, may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users\u2019 movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.\nWe use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users\u2019 settings (e.g. language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our websites may be limited.\nWe may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.\nWe, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click here.\nWe partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\") \u2013 organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish to not have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA\u2019s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out page. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. Please also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA\u2019s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\n11. What are Internet Protocol addresses?\nAn Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\"). Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.\n12. What do you do if you want to correct or delete your personal information?\nIf for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact us by e-mailing us at DPO@blizzard.com. We will respond to any request for access within 30 days or within the period as requested by applicable law.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information and will retain and use our information as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce our agreements.\nPlease note that the deletion of your data may lead to the termination of your account and all applicable services.\n13. How secure is my personal information?\nThe security of your personal information is important to us. Blizzard has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In the event that there is a security breach which is likely to be a high risk to impact rights and freedom of the data subject, we will notify such breach and remedial actions to our users/data subjects without delay. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.\nIn addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.\nIt is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent. Choosing a password you don\u2019t use on any other system is important. Changing that password occasionally is also a good idea. Another way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone; just go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.\n- What if you have a question or complaint? If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free to e-mail us at DPO@blizzard.com.\nThis Privacy Policy was last updated on January 20, 2021.", "Cisco": "\nCisco Online Privacy Statement\nCisco is committed to maintaining strong protections for our customers, products and company.

How We Use the Information We Collect\n3.1 Purposes\nWe may use the information other than photos or facial data to:\n- to provide services to you (including both the services currently provided by us via Meta Maker and these services to be rendered by us via Meta Maker in future);\n- to personalize and improve our services and your experiences when you use our services;\n- to respond to inquiries, for customer service, security, archival and backup purposes in connection with providing services of Meta Maker;\n- to monitor and analyze usage and trends of our services;\n- to personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information, or customizing the content we show you, including ads;\n- to enhance the safety and security of our products and services;\n- to verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity;\n- to use information we\u2019ve collected from cache and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with them;\n- to enforce our Terms of Service and other usage policies.\n3.2 Cloud and Server Processing\nTo give users a better experience, users\u2019 photos will be uploaded for cloud processing. Users' photos or face data will only be used for machine learning enhancements, face swap, face animator or for generating different styles of portraits based on AI-driven algorithms and not for other purposes. Meta Maker only uploads photos to the cloud that you have specifically chosen to edit if and when using the above-mentioned features. Enhanced and processed photos can only be downloaded by the one who uploaded them previously within the app. All photos or face data will be deleted from the cloud automatically in a few minutes after being processed.\nIn no way will Meta Maker use your uploaded photo for face recognition, as Meta Maker does not introduce the face recognition technologies or other technical means for processing of biometric data for the unique identification or authentication of a user. If Meta Maker decides to change the purposes of processing specified above, we will inform you on such changes prior to using your personal information within the newly set purposes and ask for your separate consent if required by the applicable laws.\n3.3 Sharing\nWe do not disclose user photos, videos or face data to third parties. Your information may be accessed and used by our service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our services. These service providers may have access to your information but only to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose that information or use it for any other purposes. These providers will collect the information sent by your mobile phone, tablet or desktop computer, and their use of that information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.\nWe may share information about you if we are (or if we believe we are) required by law or legal process (such as a subpoena, warrant or court order), if we have to respond to a lawful request from legal authorities to disclose such information, or if we need to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service or our other policies.\nIf we are acquired by a third party or may re-organise our group structure, your information may be transferred within our group and/or to a third party who will continue to operate Meta Maker or similar services under either this Privacy Policy or a different privacy policy which will be notified to you. The party to which your personal information is transferred may be located, and use your Information, outside of your jurisdiction. Other than as permitted under this Privacy Policy or as otherwise consented to by you or as required by law or legal process, we will not transfer your personal information to any other third parties for their processing for any purposes.\n4. How to Access Your Information\nYou have a right to access your personal data processed by Meta Maker and right to data portability.\nIf you believe your information on Meta Maker is not authentic or accurate and can provide us with reasonable proof regarding this, you can require us via the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy to correct these inauthentic or inaccurate information and we will use reasonable efforts to honour your request; however, we may retain an archived copy of your non-photo, non-video and non-face data information as required by law and/or for record keeping purposes. Once your account is closed or deleted, you will no longer have access to your message history, preferences or any other information associated with your use of our services. Even after you remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. Additionally, we will retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce the Terms of Service. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to update, amend or remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know why we are unable to do so, for example, certain requests may require disproportionate technical effort or extremely impractical, or are prohibited by law.\nSince Meta Maker will be used in multiple jurisdictions and we may not be possible to identify all the inconsistency between certain terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable law in your jurisdiction, thus you agree to notify us once such inconsistency is identified by you. Under this circumstance we will take necessary methods to eliminate such inconsistency, including deleting these personal information improperly collected or used by us.\n5.

INFORMATION SECURITY AND TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES\nThe Truecaller Services require by their very nature that Your personal information will be transferred to other Users across the globe.

We take all reasonable precautions to protect personal information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Truecaller has implemented physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in order to protect the information, including that the information will be stored on secured servers and protected by secured networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel.

Unlike other job sites, all of this information is shared by those who know a company best \u2014 the employees. In turn, job seekers on Glassdoor are well-researched and more informed about the jobs and companies they apply to and consider joining. This is why thousands of employers across all industries and sizes turn to Glassdoor to help them recruit and hire quality candidates at scale who stay longer. Glassdoor is available anywhere via its mobile apps.\nGlassdoor Privacy and Cookie Policy\nRevised September 3, 2020.\nWe, Glassdoor, explain in this Privacy and Cookie Policy (the \"Policy\") how we collect, process and/or use information that we receive via our websites, emails we send, and mobile applications (collectively, the \"Platform\") that link to this Policy, as amended from time to time. This Policy describes how Glassdoor collects, processes, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access, and correction of your personal information. For purposes of this Policy, personal information shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\nUnless we specify otherwise, this Policy applies only to information we collect, process and use through the Platform. This Policy does not apply to information that we collect through other channels, such as information that we collect offline, from other websites or from emails you send us, unless we notify you at the time of collection that this privacy policy applies.\nFor the purposes of this Policy, \"Glassdoor,\" \"we,\" or \"us\" shall mean the following entities:\n- Glassdoor, Inc., a Delaware corporation.\nInformation We Collect\nWe collect information about you to provide our services. In order for us to best provide our services to you (and to help make it feasible for us to do so), it is essential that we are able to collect and use the information as described in this Policy. If you are a registered user of the Platform the data collection is largely necessary for fulfilling our contractual obligations towards you and, where neither of those is the case, alternative legal grounds serve as our legal basis for processing (i.e., consent, legal obligation, and legitimate interests\u2014see details below).\nInformation You Give Us\nWhen you fill out registration forms, submit your resume, or provide us with other personal information actively, we collect that information for processing and use in accordance with this Policy. Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with personal information also may change, but here are some examples of situations in which you will have the opportunity to provide personal information to us:\n- Creating an account\n- Signing up for email alerts\n- Completing a form related to one of our products or services\n- Uploading a CV\n- Completing your Profile or preferences\n- Sending messages through Glassdoor\n- Contacting us for technical support or customer service.\nDepending on how you interact with our Platform, the personal information we collect from you may vary. For example, to create an account we may ask only for an email address and password. In other circumstances, such as when you complete a form related to a particular service offering, we may ask you to provide other information, which may include your name, phone number, and/or postal address. We also collect and store certain information associated with actions you take. For example, when you search for jobs, we store the titles, locations and general salary range (if available) of jobs you search for and click on. We also store information about the job postings that you apply to, the time and duration of your activity on our Platform, and other information about your behavior on our Platform. Because much of this information is necessary for us to provide you with our service, if you don\u2019t share this information you may not be able to use some features of the Glassdoor platform.\nIf you connect to the Platform using Facebook, Google+, or another social networking site (each a \"Social Networking Site\"), we will receive information that you authorize the Social Networking Site to share with us, which may include public profile information, birthday, current city work, school, and email address. When we receive this information, it becomes Glassdoor account information for purposes of your use of the Platform. This information also constitutes personal information and is therefore subject to this Policy. Any information that we collect from your Social Networking Site account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the Social Networking Site, so please consult the Social Networking Site\u2019s privacy and data practices. You have the ability to disconnect your Social Networking Site account from your Glassdoor account by adapting the privacy settings in your Social Networking Site account. If you come to the Platform through a Social Networking Site, from other websites or with devices that enable third parties to collect information from or about you, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies.\nOn certain Glassdoor domains, when you set up an individual user account on the Platform, you may create a profile (a \"Profile\") that will include personal information you provide. At your request, we will create your Profile with information we extract from a resume you have uploaded on the Platform. When you fill out and save your Profile, your saved Profile can be viewed by prospective employers, subject to visibility settings you control. (For example, when you apply to certain Easy Apply jobs posted by a Glassdoor employer client, we may share a static image of your saved Profile with that employer in connection with your application). Because your anonymity on our Platform is important, your Profile does not include information you submit to the Platform anonymously (for example, the reviews, salaries, benefits, and company ratings information you submit anonymously).\nWe may host an Easy Apply application that asks for relevant information generally considered sensitive (such as a driver\u2019s license number for truck driver job, or a government-issued identification number for a government job). Some applications may ask you to identify your racial/ethnic origin or disabilities on a strictly voluntary basis (e.g. for purposes of providing equal employment opportunities) and you may choose not to submit this information without any detriment to your application. For our EU users, data about racial/ethnic origin and disabilities are considered special categories of personal data under Article 9 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"). When we host Easy Apply applications that collect this kind of data, we pass that information along to the employer when we submit your application and do not retain it on our systems. But please remember, you should not include this kind of data in any resume you upload to the Platform or submit it in any other scenarios, except where we specifically prompt you to provide such information such as described above.\nSome of our Easy Apply applications allow you to apply to a job hosted on the site of one of our affiliates. When you click on the Easy Apply button, and confirm by clicking the Apply button, your application will be submitted for the job through one of our affiliates. Before the Apply button, you will see a notice informing you that the application is hosted on an affiliate\u2019s site, including a link in the affiliate\u2019s terms and privacy policy. You will have the opportunity to open the affiliate\u2019s terms and privacy policy and read them prior to submitting your application.\nGlassdoor provides the Glassdoor Messaging Service, a two-way message proxy and relay system. By utilizing the Glassdoor Messaging Service, you acknowledge that you are asking Glassdoor to send these messages on your behalf. This includes your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials. When you ask Glassdoor to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an employer via Glassdoor or the Glassdoor Messaging Service or store such application, you understand Glassdoor reserves the right to reformat such application or message.\nWe process, monitor, review, store and analyze such content and other materials, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of our Terms, and improvement of our services. Examples of such improvements would be optimizing our search results, improving job postings, matching you with a job posting or employer, ensuring you are provided with personally relevant product features and communications, and preventing fraud and spam. As a result of this activity, or due to technical malfunction, in certain circumstances such content may be delayed or may not be delivered to the intended recipient. Glassdoor may (but is not obligated to) notify you in such an event. By using Glassdoor Messaging Service or otherwise providing user content through Glassdoor, you acknowledge that this activity is necessary for maintaining the quality of Glassdoor and for providing the Glassdoor Messaging Service. Please also note that since the Glassdoor Messaging Services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those email service providers.\nIf you enter credit card information on the Platform in connection with a purchase, that information is sent directly from your browser to the third-party service provider we use to manage credit card processing and we do not store it on our servers. The service provider is not permitted to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.\nWhen you submit personal information to a third party and are informed at the time of collection that your information may be shared with us, we may collect that information for lawful marketing purposes.\nEmployers with Free Employer Accounts may provide us with work email addresses of their employees for use to send an email asking those employees to leave candid reviews of the employer on the Platform.\nCategories of personal information collected by Glassdoor may include Job Postings (your job postings on Glassdoor), Profile Information (Name, Email Address, Resume, Current Job Title, Past Job History, Age, Gender), Sales & Support History (Purchase History, Payment Details, and other sales support interactions), Job Applications (jobs you have applied to), Job Interests & Activity (job preferences and your activity interacting with jobs, e.g. saving a job), Security & Login Information (Your login events, password changes, email changes and mobile device information), Site Activity (Pages you viewed and \"like activity\"), Marketing Activity (Marketing programs you have joined, content downloaded, etc.), User Feedback (Feedback you have provided Glassdoor via email, app/website and other channels), and/or Content You Contributed (Employer reviews, Salary Reports, Benefit reviews, Interview reviews, Employer photos). We may also collect Additional Personal and Demographic Information you may elect to give us, as set forth in further detail below.\nInformation We Collect Automatically\nWhen you use the Platform, your device is automatically providing information to us so we can respond and customize our response to you. The type of information we collect by automated means generally includes technical information about your computer, such as your IP address or other device identifier, the type of device you use, and operating system version. The information we collect also may include usage information and statistics about your interaction with the Platform. That information may include the URLs of our web pages that you visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, location data (if you have enabled access to your location on your mobile device), and other information about how you used the Platform.\nAutomated means of data collection include the following:\nCookies And Tracking Technologies. Technologies such as: cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called \"flash cookies\"), mobile identifiers and similar technologies (\"Cookies\") are used by Glassdoor and our partners (such as advertising, marketing and analytics providers) (\"Ad Partners\"). We use Cookies to remember users\u2019 settings as well as for authentication and analytics. These technologies may be used in analyzing trends, administering the Platform, tracking users\u2019 movements around the Platform and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Our Ad Partners may also use such technologies to deliver advertisements to you. You can control the use of Cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable Cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile application each time you access a website on our Platform. For example, when you access a Glassdoor website, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends when you visit any website. These server logs include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, and pages viewed.\nDevice Information. We collect information about the device you use to access the Platform, including type of device, operating system, settings, and unique device identifiers, and IP address. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you\u2019re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you\u2019re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or Android phone. We collect the device type and any other information you choose to provide, such as username, geolocation, or email address. We also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software records information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.\nHow We Use Information\nWe use the information we collect to provide our services. In order for us to best provide our services (and to help make it feasible for us to do so), it is essential that we are able to collect and use the information as described in this Policy.\nGlassdoor\u2019s mission is to help people everywhere find a job and company they love. Since each of our affiliates shares a similar goal of helping people find jobs and helping employers hire quality candidates, Glassdoor and its affiliates have developed the HR Tech Privacy Center. The HR Tech Privacy Center is designed to educate our users about our affiliates and how we share data with them to provide robust service offerings to our users. We encourage you to visit the HR Tech Privacy Center to learn more. Examples of our affiliates include: Indeed, Simply Hired, Syft, Resume.com, Workopolis, Wowjobs, Engineerjobs, RescueMyResumes and Resumeperfector.\nAs a registered user of our Platform, Glassdoor processes your information in accordance with our contractual obligations based on the Terms of Use and, where this is not the case, alternative legal grounds serve as our legal basis for processing (i.e., consent, legal obligation, and legitimate interests) including personal information for the following purposes:\n- to provide you with personalized content, services and offers of services offered by Glassdoor, as well as other promotional content and services (for example, Glassdoor and its affiliates may use your previous search and browsing history (e.g. the jobs you click on), or your resume, Profile, application information, and responses to screener questions to determine relevant search results and provide you with recommended jobs on Glassdoor or on sites of Glassdoor affiliates, or Glassdoor may reach out to you about jobs or companies you may be interested in; we also use your IP address and mobile device for these purposes); For the purposes of this Policy, \"affiliates\" means any entity that directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control of or with Glassdoor, Inc., now or in the future. \"Control\" for these purposes means having a majority of shares or the right and ability to direct management.\n- to moderate and display the employer reviews, interview reviews, salary reports and other content you have submitted for the benefit of our other users;\n- to customize and improve the features, performance, and support of the Glassdoor site and sites of Glassdoor affiliates;\n- to communicate with you or initiate communication with you (for marketing or service-related purposes) on behalf of third parties through your Glassdoor account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you provide to us or (where it is lawful for us to do so) that we otherwise obtain from third-party resources;\n- to permit Glassdoor or a Glassdoor affiliate to recommend a Glassdoor user (and that user\u2019s resume or resume extract) to an employer hosted by Glassdoor or to an employer hosted by a Glassdoor affiliate, subject to visibility settings you control (for example, Glassdoor may use application materials\u2014including resumes and responses to screener questions\u2014to determine whether the words of any job seeker\u2019s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a job posting or resume query, and vice-versa, we may then differentiate matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to employers as matches or not matches);\n- to permit Glassdoor to contact Glassdoor users with respect to such recommendations, subject to visibility settings you control;\n- to provide relevant advertising, including interest-based advertising from us and third parties, which may mean that we share non-personally identifiable information, such as your job title, to third-party advertisers;\n- to transmit your application and save your application materials;\n- to share your saved Profile or resume with employers, subject to visibility settings you control;\n- to allow Glassdoor and Glassdoor affiliates to process your personal data for the purpose of improving for internal operations, including detecting and preventing fraud and spam, troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement (this includes use of your IP address and mobile device information to help diagnose problems with our service and to administer the Platform);\n- to create aggregated statistical data that does not identify you individually and that we can commercialize (for example, we use mobile device data and IP addresses to create anonymized, aggregate demographic information);\n- for other purposes that you separately authorise as you interact with Glassdoor.\nWhen we collect any information that does not identify you as a specific natural person (\"Non-Personal Information\"), we are permitted to use and disclose this information for any purpose, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, except where we are required to do otherwise by applicable law. Examples of Non-Personal Information include: physical location information; demographic information, including gender, dates of birth, ZIP codes, etc.; or any personal information that has been anonymized, aggregated or de-identified. If we combine any Non-Personal Information with your personal information (such as combining your ZIP code with your name), we will use and disclose such combined information as personal information in accordance with this policy. Similarly, if applicable law requires that we treat certain Non-Personal Information as personal information, we will use and disclose this information as personal information in accordance with this policy.\nHow We Share Information/Recipients\nWe only disclose your personal information to third parties as follows:\n- We use affiliated and unaffiliated service providers all over the world to help us deliver our service and run our business subject to strict confidentiality agreements. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us;\nCategory of Third-PartyCategories of Data Shared With Such Third Parties\nAdvertising Partners & ExchangesJob Postings, Profile Information, Site Activity, Marketing Activity\nAffiliates (as detailed above)Job Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Job Applications, Site Activity\nAnalytics & Optimization ProvidersJob Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Job Applications, Security & Login Information, Site Activity, User Feedback\nCloud Storage & Computing Platforms & Associated Tools and Software ProvidersDiversity and Inclusion Information, Job Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Job Applications, Security & Login Information, Site Activity, User Feedback, Content You Contributed\nContent Moderation & Support ProvidersJob Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Job Applications, Security & Login Information, Site Activity, User Feedback, Content You Contributed\nCustomer Relationship Management & Sales Transaction/Optimization ProvidersJob Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Marketing Activity, User Feedback\nInformation Technology Service & Support ProvidersJob Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Security & Login Information, Site Activity, User Feedback\nEmail & Email Delivery ProvidersJob Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Job Applications, Marketing Activity, User Feedback\nEmployersJob Applications, Profile Information\nFinancial Transaction, Accounting, and Audit providersJob Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History\nFraud Detection & Security ProvidersJob Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Job Applications, Security & Login Information, Site Activity, Content You Contributed\nMarketing and Prospecting ProvidersJob Postings, Profile Information, Sales & Support History, Site Activity, Marketing Activity\n- We may also share your information with Glassdoor affiliates, namely any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Glassdoor. Such affiliates shall process your personal data either (1) at our direction as a processor under a contractual relationship, (2) as a separate controller of your information where you are informed at the time of collection or processing of their relationship to you, or (3) where we believe it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest, and where such purposes are aligned with those for which you provided your personal data to us. These instances and processing activities are outlined in the \"How We Use Your Information\" section above and will include data falling into the categories described in the section \"Information You Give Us\". We encourage you to visit the HR Tech Privacy Center to learn more.\n- We will disclose data If we believe in good faith such disclosure is necessary (1) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants or legal process served on us (though we reserve the right to take action on behalf of our users to defend their right to anonymity when we believe there is a legitimate basis to do so, because candid, lawful, anonymous free speech is fundamental to Glassdoor\u2019s mission of workplace transparency); (2) to enforce our Glassdoor Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; (4) as we otherwise deem necessary and is permitted by applicable laws to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the users of our services, or third parties; or (5) as permitted under applicable laws to meet national security and similar requirements;\n- In reorganization or sale of our company or assets, your data may be transferred, subject to the acquirer and its affiliates accepting the commitments made in this Policy and compliance with applicable law;\n- If you apply for a particular job through the Platform, we will disclose your personal information to the employer to whom you apply and any vendors they are working with to process your application;\n- We invite you to include your resume or other information in more generally available formats for us to share with employers (for example, when you apply to Easy Apply jobs, a static image of your saved Profile), subject to visibility settings you control;\n- We share certain information that does not identify you personally, but which is unique to your use of the Platform, such as job titles that you have entered at the time of registration or on your profile. When we share such information, we do not link job titles with your name when we provide this information to others, such as advertisers, recruiters or employers;\n- We will otherwise share personal information with your consent.\n- As described in this section, Glassdoor may share your data with our affiliates. When we share this data, this may be considered a \"sale\" under applicable law. Once we begin sharing data you will be able to opt-out of this sharing by accessing the link in our footer titled \"Do Not Sell My Info\"\nThe Legal Basis on Which Glassdoor Processes Your Personal Data\nGlassdoor collects and processes your personal information on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the personal information being provided and the type of processing involved.\nPerformance of a Contract\nMost of the personal Data processed by Glassdoor is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreements with you (among them, your agreement to our Terms of Use and this Policy), or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement. An example of this would be where Glassdoor sends a job seeker\u2019s application to an employer.\nLegitimate Interest\nA second ground relied upon by Glassdoor for other types of processing of your personal information is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Glassdoor. Such legitimate interests may include where Glassdoor sends you marketing about our products and services or where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf. A further example would be where Glassdoor shares your personal information with our affiliates as detailed in the \"How We Share Information/Recipients\" section above. Glassdoor will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.\nCompliance with a Legal Obligation\nA third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Glassdoor to comply with a legal obligation. An example of this would be where Glassdoor is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time or transmit them to a user in order to comply with local legal requirements. Another example is when Glassdoor collects Equal Employment Opportunity (or similar programs in your country) information on behalf of employers as part of the process of processing your applications to employers through the Glassdoor platform.\nConsent\nFinally, in certain limited situations, Glassdoor relies on your consent in order to process your personal information. Where Glassdoor requires your consent in order to collect and process certain personal information, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured unless Glassdoor has another lawful basis on which to rely. For example, your consent may be sought where you submit feedback to Glassdoor, or in certain instances where you initiate a marketing message or other communication with Glassdoor. You can withdraw your consent, as detailed in the \"Other Important Privacy Information\" section below, where applicable.\nAdditional Personal and Demographic Information You May Elect to Give Us\nAt Glassdoor, our mission is to help everyone find a job and company they love. We also believe transparency is one of the most powerful forces for good in the world. At its core, transparency about the workplace empowers people with the right information to make the right decisions about their careers. In an effort to innovate and evolve, and in order for us to take workplace transparency to the next level, you now have the option to provide us with personal diversity and inclusion (\"D&I\") information.\nIn particular, we may ask you to provide (and we may subsequently collect) certain categories of D&I information about you, including information relating but not limited to:\n- Age\n- Disability\n- Gender Identity\n- Language\n- Leading Personality Trait\n- Marital Status\n- Parental Status\n- Race & Ethnicity\n- Religion\n- Sexual Orientation\n- Veteran Status\nD&I Information Principles\nWe recognize that some of these categories of information are sensitive and very personal. We therefore want to be fully transparent in how we collect and process this data so that you can make an informed decision whether or not you want to provide this information to us.\nFirst, you are never obligated to provide this information to access or use the Glassdoor platform. Glassdoor will always remain a place you can visit to find out information about companies and jobs without the need to supply personal information beyond your comfort level, i.e., the level at which you elect to share information about yourself (except as required in order to use a particular service, such as personal information necessary to apply for a job).\nSecond, we will only collect and process D&I information based on your explicit consent.\nThird, you will always have the option at any time to remove previously supplied D&I information, or to update D&I information that may have changed.\nFourth, we employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures to safeguard the information we collect online. However, you should know that no company can fully eliminate security risks, so we cannot make guarantees about any part of our services.\nFifth, we use D&I data only for the purposes described in this Policy unless we notify you at the time of collection that we may use it in some other manner.\nSixth, we take precautions to ensure that your decision to provide your D&I information does not inadvertently negate your anonymity or reveal your identity on our platform. For example, we may limit the number of reviews or other pieces of content required with certain D&I attributes for those D&I attributes to become visible to the public in order to ensure that we do not inadvertently disclose sufficient information about a particular user\u2019s personal attributes that would make them identifiable. While we take your anonymity extremely seriously and make our best efforts to ensure that D&I information does not inadvertently lead to your identification, there are two instances in which such disclosure of a user\u2019s identification may occur:\n- In order to provide a voice and agency to those who, regardless of the risks of identification, affirmatively wish to have their opinions and experiences heard, we may provide an option for users to opt into the disclosure of their D&I data in a manner and to an extent that may lead to loss of their anonymity on our platform. These choices will be conspicuously marked and will require affirmative assent to verify your understanding, intention, and acceptance of this risk of identification.\n- While we try very hard to plan for all contingencies, we are not perfect. The preventative measures we take and our platform\u2019s technological performance may not always function the way we intend when combined with the complex realities of many millions of unique workplaces into which we have limited, imperfect visibility. As we collect more personal information about our users that may be displayed publicly, there may be instances where the mechanisms we have designed to protect your anonymity fail. This is never our intention, and we take multiple steps to ensure this is not the case. But, in the interests of transparency, we want to be sure we make you are fully aware of this risk.\nSeventh, we will never sell or transfer your D&I information to a third-party in a way that would present a risk to your anonymity (i.e., we will never transfer your D&I information to a third-party in conjunction with other particular information about you sufficient for a third-party to identify you). We may, however, disclose your D&I information to one of our affiliates or service providers as defined and described in this Policy to enable affiliate or service-provider data processing for purposes consistent with this Policy and the principles outlined herein (see the section of this Policy titled \"How We Share Information/Recipients\"). We may also anonymize and/or aggregate and make available data to third parties and the public as described in this Policy (e.g., to provide insights into diversity metrics in particular areas, industries, companies, or countries, or make available data reports outlining economic or labor trends).\nHow We Use D&I Information\nDepending on your selections if and as you elect to disclose D&I information, we will use the data you provide to implement new platform features, track various diversity and inclusion trends across industries, countries, and globally, and push employers to begin sharing diversity data and make changes to their practices in response to the insights we provide.\nAs a registered user of our Platform, Glassdoor processes your D&I and some non-D&I information in accordance with our contractual obligations based on the Terms of Use, this Policy, and your consent for the following purposes:\n- Providing insights into wage discrepancies (e.g., showing gender and racial/ethnic wage gap disparities)\n- Providing D&I-based analysis of jobs and companies (e.g., we may utilize D&I information to generate reports highlighting employers that best embrace diversity, support LGBTQ rights, minimize wage gaps, etc.)\n- Providing diversity and inclusion metrics and ratings (e.g., provide insights for job seekers who want to learn more about diversity and inclusion with respect to specific industries or companies)\n- Providing search optimization and filtering via diversity data (e.g., providing users the ability to filter Glassdoor content or companies based on certain employer qualities or employee experiences and attributes; for example, employers that are supportive of LGBTQ+ rights or who are particularly supportive of women with respect to enhanced maternity leave benefits; As users provide D&I information, their reviews may be associated with aggregated categories, such as filtering for all the African-American, Pacific Islander, and Latinx reviews for a particular company/all the reviews for an industry. In some instances, particular reviews may be tagged with D&I attributes.)\n- Enhancing employer/employee diversity disclosures for job seekers (e.g., we may allow employers to share internal diversity data, diversity program details, and testimonials from their own employees; we may provide opportunities for jobseekers and employees to engage and have anonymous discussions on D&I-related and other topics, )\n- Incorporating D&I information into existing or new products and services otherwise detailed in this Policy (see the section of this Policy titled \"How We Use Your Information\")\nHow We Share D&I Information/Recipients\nAs we describe in Section Seven of our D&I Information Principles above, we may share D&I information consistent with our Policy overall. Please refer to the section of this Policy titled \"How We Share Information/Recipients\".\nCookie Policy and Ad Choices\nThis Cookie Policy describes how Glassdoor uses Cookies and similar technologies. For more information on our general data privacy practices, please see the full Privacy Policy.\nCookies\nCookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone, or other device when you first visit a page. We use cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called \"flash cookies\"), mobile identifiers and similar technologies (\"Cookies\") to help us recognize you on the Platform, enhance your user experience, understand usage of the Platform, and show you relevant advertising. Cookies may also be set by other websites or services that run content on the page you\u2019re visiting. After you register on the Platform, we may connect information we collect from the Cookies set by us and our partners with other information received from you. The provision of your data via Cookies is voluntary except for those Cookies that we place on your device because we need them for the performance of our Platform and our services.\nWhat types of Cookies do we use?\nWe use two types of Cookies on the Platform: \"session cookies\" and \"persistent cookies.\" Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that remain on your device until you leave the Platform. A persistent Cookie remains on your device for much longer until you manually delete it (how long the Cookie remains will depend on the duration or \"lifetime\" of the specific Cookie and your browser settings).\nWhat are Cookies used for?\nCookies transmit information about you and your use of the Platform, such as your browser type, search preferences, job titles, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. With the exception of an identifier Cookie that we associate with registered accounts to prevent fraud by members of the Platform, Cookies link to certain unique information such as the job titles that you entered at time of registration or on your profile, but this is not linked to your name. We use four types of cookies: Strictly Necessary, Functional, Analytics, and Targeting. You can reference which specific cookies fall into each category by using our Cookie Consent Tool in our website footer.\nWe use Cookies for things like:\nPurposeExplanation\nAuthenticationWe use Cookies to help us determine whether or not you\u2019ve signed in to the Platform and to keep you signed in during visits as you access different pages.\nSecurityWe use Cookies to enable and support security features, prevent fraud, and protect your data from unauthorised access.\nPreferences and FeaturesWe use Cookies to enable features and help us provide you with personalised content, such as showing you your recent search activity.\nAdvertisingWe use Cookies to deliver, evaluate and improve advertising, such as by using information about you to provide relevant advertising both on and off the Platform. Our Ad Partners may use a cookie to determine whether you\u2019ve already been shown an advert or how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interacted with an ad.\nAnalytics and PerformanceWe use Cookies to analyze how our visitors use the Platform and to monitor site performance. These Cookies help us to identify and fix errors, understand and improve services, research and test out different features, and monitor how our visitors reach our sites.\nTargeting Cookies: Ad Choices and Managing Cookies\nGlassdoor works with several third parties to provide you with personalized, interest-based advertising. We may target ads to you, and measure their performance, on and off the Platform using:\n- Member-provided profile information (e.g., job title, occupation, location, authorized information shared from your Social Networking Site)\n- Your use of the Platform (e.g., search history, job clicks, companies you follow);\n- Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket).\n- IP address or mobile device location information (to the extent you have enabled location tracking on your device);\n- Cookies (both on and off the Platform) which may include information from the Ad Partners we use to help deliver relevant ads to you.\nHow We Work with Third-Party Ad Partners\nWhen we work with our Ad Partners to serve you personalized, interest-based advertising, we do not share information with them that they can use to identify you or associate with you as a specific individual unless you have instructed us to do so (such as when you fill out a lead form in an ad, or approve your Profile for display to employers). Similarly, if one of these Ad Partners has information about you saved in one of their own Cookies on your browser, they use that information to help us send you a relevant ad, but they do not share with us information that we can associate with you as an individual.\nWe work with third parties, such as Google Analytics, to provide analytics services that use the Cookies set on your device to measure the performance of advertising and track traffic to Glassdoor generally. We have also implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, which categorizes Cookie information so that we and third-party service providers can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on the Platform and various websites across the internet. In addition, a Cookie on some of our employer clients sites provides us with aggregate data about the number of applications submitted to those sites by users of Platform.\nConsenting to Cookies and Opting Out of Cookies\nAs we describe in our cookie banner (for our users in jurisdictions where we display a consent banner) and in our Cookie Consent Tool (located in the Glassdoor website footer), we use Cookies that are strictly necessary for us to provide the services you use and you cannot opt out of these Cookies on the Platform. By utilizing our Cookie Consent Tool, you can reject all but Strictly Necessary cookies, or opt out if specific categories of cookies at any time (as described above and in the Tool). You are also able to disable placement of some (but not all) Cookies by setting your browser to decline cookies, though this may worsen your user experience. Additionally, you can also control, manage and/or delete cookies via your browser settings. A useful resource for information about deleting and controlling cookies can be found at AboutCookies.org.\nIf you enable location data for the mobile version of the Platform (including any version installed as a native application), we may use your location data to serve you geo-targeted ads for employers and other advertisers that are local to you. In such instances, we do not share your location with the advertiser or advertising network; rather, we provide the advertiser or advertising network with a means to push ads through to users located in certain areas. You may disable location services at any time in your device privacy settings or the Glassdoor native app settings.\nAd Partner Cookies\nHere are some options for managing the third-party Cookies used by our Ad Partners:\nWhen visiting Glassdoor from a region where applicable law requires consent for the use of non-strictly necessary cookies, we surface a cookie consent banner and request your consent. You can adjust Cookie preferences on Glassdoor through our Cookie Consent Tool located in the Glassdoor footer.\nYou are also able to opt out of other third-party advertiser and ad network placement of Cookies or targeted advertising generally by visiting the following links: Network Advertising Initiative; Digital Advertising Alliance; European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (for users in the EU); The Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (for users in Canada); or you can follow opt-out instructions of the Ad Partners we work with listed here. You will continue to receive generic ads by companies not listed with these opt-out tools.\nYou can opt out of tracking by Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting services by visiting Google Ads Settings or by downloading the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.\nPlease note: If ads or other features on the Platform are provided by third parties, those parties set and use their own Cookies that are subject to those third parties\u2019 privacy notices and policies. Glassdoor does not have access to, or control over, these Cookies. Also, if you respond to ads posted by third parties or submit information to third parties via the Platform, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies.\nDo Not Track Signals\nWe do not currently respond to \u2018do not track\u2019 signals and similar settings or mechanisms. When you use the Platform, we try to provide a customized experience.\nOther Important Privacy Information\nYour Privacy Rights\nGlassdoor operates globally and is therefore subject to a variety of data privacy laws that confer a range of privacy rights upon our users. We have chosen to provide all of these privacy rights to our users regardless of their location.\n- If you wish to submit a data rights request to access, correct, delete, export, rectify, update, or ask questions about your personal data, you may do so via our Privacy Requests Page. Your name and email address will be requested. A verification email will be sent to you to verify your identity. An agent may submit your name and email address on your behalf via the Privacy Request Page, but we can only verify your request by asking you to click the verification link in the verification email.\n- In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information or ask us to restrict processing of your personal information via our Privacy Requests Page.\n- You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the \"unsubscribe\" or \"opt-out\" link in the marketing emails we send you. Registered users can manage their account settings and email marketing preferences as described in the \"Choices Regarding Your Personal Information\" section below. If you are an unregistered user, or to opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), you may contact us using the contact details provided under the \"How to contact us\".\n- Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.\n- Glassdoor does not process your information for the purpose of making automated decisions about you which has a legal or other significant effect.\nGlassdoor does not discriminate against users\u2019 that exercise any of these privacy rights. We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to keep any information in our archives that we deem necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.\nChoices Regarding Your Personal Information\nIn addition to your rights outlined above, if you are an individual consumer member of Glassdoor, you can manage your account settings in the \"Account Settings\" page on the Platform where we provide you with the opportunity to \u2018opt-out\u2019 of having your personal information used for certain purposes. If you are an employer with an Employer Account, you can manage you can manage your account settings in the \"Account Settings\" page on the Glassdoor for Employers website. Employers can manage settings for email marketing by Glassdoor by clicking here.\nWe will send you notifications and if, and to the extent, you have opted-in to promotional communications, or other messages using the contact information (e.g., your email address, your mobile device identifier) you provided to us when you registered or when you requested information from us. You may opt-out of continuing to receive optional messages by following the instructions included in each message. Also, you can control most of the emails you receive from us by editing your email preferences within \"My Account\" settings on the site; provided you will need to separately opt-out of receiving our various blog post update emails by unsubscribing to each blog that you have originally subscribed to. You can control the mobile push notifications within the \"Me\" section of the mobile app.\nWe will send you service-related announcements when we believe it is necessary to do so. Generally, you cannot opt-out of these announcements, which are not primarily promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your account. In some cases, you can stop or limit the information we collect by automated means. To learn more about how you may be able to stop or limit our receipt of that information please review the section entitled Cookie Policy and Ad Choices.\nClose Your Account\nIf you\u2019d like to close your Glassdoor account, you can do so within your Account Settings on the Platform. For specific instructions, please see this article in our Help Center. When you close your account, you will no longer have full access to salaries, reviews, and interviews, and any content you have submitted will be pulled from the display on the Platform, but we reserve the right to keep any information in a closed account in our archives that we deem necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. If, after you close your account, you wish to know which personal information we keep you can proceed in accordance with your rights set out above.\nHow Long We Keep Your Personal Information\nWe keep your personal information only so long as we need it to provide the Platform to you and fulfill the purposes described in this Policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your personal information with and who carries out services on our behalf. Retention periods can vary significantly based on the type of information and how it is used. Our retention periods are based on criteria that include legally mandated retention periods, pending or potential litigation, our intellectual property or ownership rights, contract requirements, operational directives or needs, and historical archiving. When we no longer need to use your personal information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, we\u2019ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can\u2019t identify you.\nSecurity Safeguards\nSecurity. We employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures to safeguard the information we collect online. However, no company can fully eliminate security risks, so we cannot make guarantees about any part of our services. You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret. Once you have registered with us, we will never ask you for your password. Please create a unique password for your Glassdoor account and do not use it for any other web services or applications. Do not share your password with anyone else.\nTips For A Responsible Job Search. We actively monitor the Platform for job postings that violate our Terms of Use. If we detect fraudulent activity, we remove the job posting from the Platform. However, fraudulent job postings can sometimes appear and we urge you to exercise caution in your job search. Please consider the following tips when conducting your search:\n- Do not send money to a prospective employer.\n- Do not give out personal or financial account information to a new employer via email.\n- Do not cash checks or transfer funds for your employer.\n- Beware of job postings that ask you to send your resume to a free email service address (e.g., gmail, yahoo, etc).\n- Do not include sensitive information like your National Insurance number in your resume.\n- Beware of job listings with spelling errors and bad grammar.\n- If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n- Do your homework. Be sure to research any job opportunity that interests you.\nIf you see a suspicious job posting, please contact us here.
